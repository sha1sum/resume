            I completed courses for Cisco CCNA (Cisco-Certified Network Associate) certification
            in 2008 at Polk Community College and received a high school diploma from Lake Wales
            High School in 2002.

            A self-proclaimed "nerd" for the past twenty-seven years (since 1994) starting at the
            age of eleven, much of my knowledge is self-taught, Google-taught (or Yahoo!-taught if
            you go back far enough), or the result of the teachings of a few respected mentors
            throughout my adolescence. Want proof? Consider testing my skills to be impressed!
